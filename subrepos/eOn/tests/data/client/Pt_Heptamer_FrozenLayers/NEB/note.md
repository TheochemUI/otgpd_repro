This is how these work.
- Generate the configurations somewhere.
- Relax the start and end point
Use them.

For the MATLAB code in particular, say `conf13_BM7.mat`:
- Relaxed positions are present
- These need to be copied into the files
- The box dimensions were hard-coded and are:
  `1.9209e+01, 0, 0, 0, 1.9012e+01, 0, 0, 0, 3.0000e+01`
