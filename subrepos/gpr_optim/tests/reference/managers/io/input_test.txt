% Only active frozen atoms are taken into account in the covariance function.
% A frozen atom is activated, when it is within the radius of 'actdist_fro'
% from some moving atom in some configuration on the path.
% Once a frozen atom is activated, it stays active from then on.
% If 'actdist_fro' is set to infinity, all frozen atoms are taken into account.
% When a frozen atom is activated, its coordinates and atomtype index are added
% to 'conf_info.conf_fro' and 'conf_info.atomtype_fro', respectively,
% and removed from 'conf_info_inactive.conf_fro' and 'conf_info_inactive.atomtype_fro'.
% If the new frozen atom activates new pairtypes, also 'conf_info.pairtype'
% and 'conf_info.n_pt' are updated.

dimer_sep = 0.01 % define the dimer separation (distance from the middle point of the dimer to the two images)
method_rot = @rot_iter_lbfgs % use the conjugate gradient method for rotations
method_trans = @trans_iter_lbfgs % use the conjugate gradient method for translations
param_trans = [0.1, 0.1] % define a step length for convex regions and maximum step length

% 'eval_image1' indicates if image 1 of the dimer is evaluted (1) or not (0)
% after each relaxation phase in addition to the middle point of the dimer
eval_image1 = 0

% 'T_dimer' defines the final convergence threshold for 'maxF_R', which is
% the maximum component of the force acting on the middle point of the dimer (i.e., the
% algorithm is stopped when all components of the accurate force are below 'T_dimer').
T_dimer = 0.01

% 'initrot_nogp' indicates if the initial rotations are performed without GP (1) or with GP (0).
initrot_nogp = 0

% 'T_anglerot_init' defines a convergence threshold for the rotation angle
% in the initial rotations performed in the beginning of the algorithm
% (the dimer is not rotated when the estimated rotation angle is less than this).
T_anglerot_init = 0.0873

% 'num_iter_initrot' defines the maximum number of initial rotations (0 if initial rotations skipped).
num_iter_initrot = 0

% 'inittrans_nogp' is an indicator if an initial test translation step is taken without GP (1)
% or if GP is used right after initial rotations (0).
inittrans_nogp = 0

% 'T_anglerot_gp' defines a convergence threshold for the rotation angle
% during a relaxation phase (the dimer is not rotated when the estimated
% rotation angle is less than this).
T_anglerot_gp = 0.01

% 'num_iter_rot_gp' defines a maximum number of rotation iterations per
% translation during a relaxation phase.
num_iter_rot_gp = 10

% If 'divisor_T_dimer_gp' is set to zero, the default convergence threshold
% for each relaxation phase for the approximated 'maxF_R' on the
% approximated energy surface is 1/10 of the 'T_dimer'. To save inner
% iterations during the first relaxation phases, one can set a positive
% value for 'divisor_T_dimer_gp', so that the GP convergence threshold will
% be 1/'divisor_T_dimer_gp' of the smallest accurate 'maxF_R' obtained so
% far, but not less than 1/10 of the 'T_dimer'. If the approximation error
% is assumed to not decrease more than that during one outer iteration,
% there is no need for more accurate relaxation on an approximated surface.
divisor_T_dimer_gp = 10

% 'disp_max' defines the maximum displacement of the middle point of the
% dimer from the nearest observed data point. Thus, the last inner step is
% rejected and the relaxation phase stopped, if the distance to the nearest
% observed data point is larger than 'disp_max'.
disp_max = 0.5

% 'ratio_at_limit' defines the limit for the ratio (< 1) of inter-atomic
% distances between image and its "nearest" observed data point.
% More precisely, the last inner step is rejected and the relaxation phase
% stopped if the following does not hold:
% There is an observed data point so that all inter-atomic distances of the
% current image are more than 'ratio_at_limit' (by default 2/3) but less
% than 1/'ratio_at_limit' (3/2) times the corresponding inter-atomic
% distance of the observed data point.
ratio_at_limit = 0.666666666666667

% 'num_bigiter_initloc' defines the number of outer iterations started from the initial location 'R_init'.
% After that, each relaxation phase is started from the latest converged dimer.
% Starting each round from the initial location may improve stability (and decrease outer iterations),
% but starting from the latest dimer may decrease the number of inner iterations during the relaxation phases.
%% num_bigiter_initloc = inf

% 'num_bigiter_initparam' defines the number of outer iterations where the hyperparameter
% optimization is started from values initialized based on the range of current data.
% After that, the optimization is started from the values of the previous round.
%% num_bigiter_initparam = inf

num_bigiter = 300 % define the maximum number of outer iterations (new sets of observations)
num_iter = 1000 % define the maximum number of inner iterations (steps during a relaxation phase)

% 'islarge_num_iter' indicates if 'num_iter' is assumed to be much larger than required
% for dimer convergence on accurate energy surface. If not (0), the next relaxation phase is
% continued from the current dimer in case 'num_iter' is reached.
islarge_num_iter = 1

load_file = none % start normally from beginning
save_file = none % no saves after each outer iteration
